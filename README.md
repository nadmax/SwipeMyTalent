# SwipeMyTalent

SwipeMyTalent is a service exchanges platform for freelancers.
It aims to break the isolation many freelancers face by offering a space for mutual support, collaboration, and growth.

## Why SwipeMyTalent?

Like many new freelancers, I struggled:

- Discovery calls that turn into overpriced coaching
- Job applications that go unanswered
- Endless outreach with no results
- Personal projects that attract no one

Eventually, you start doubting yourself.  
Losing confidence and sometimes youâ€™re forced to take a day job "just for now."  
Why are we all struggling alone?

Why not build a space where we can:

- Exchange services
- Expand our networks
- Get feedback and recommendations
- Gain visibility without breaking the bank

And that's how SwipeMyTalent was born.

## Run the app

Thanks to Docker, you can easily start the app with the following command.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

To stop it

```sh
docker compose down
```
